              <p>
                At LocalSM, we do not believe in bureaucratic processes, elaborate hierarchies, or micro-management. Instead, we hire extremely high-agency individuals, align them behind clear, audacious missions, and get out of their way.
              </p>
              <p>
                This means you have complete autonomy over your work, your budget, and your decisions. It also means you carry full accountability for the outcomes. There are no excuses, no shifting of blame, and no hiding behind committees.
              </p>
              <p>
                We work long hours, we debate fiercely, and we challenge each other’s ideas constantly. We do this not because we are difficult, but because we care deeply about the quality of what we build.
